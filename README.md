# react-todo
A todo app using React Hooks. This is mostly a learning project to re-familiarize myself with React, and learn hooks along the way.

I based this app off of this article: https://medium.com/@shuvohabib/react-hooks-in-action-building-a-todo-app-hint-no-classes-53e0b4028ba5

The article is definitely not the most intuitive way to start (or even jump back in with little knowledge) as it's missing some key important factors (imports, exports, etc), but having the author's github helps sort most of those things out. It would likely not be an issue for someone more familiar with React.
